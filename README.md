An IoT-based baby care system designed to automate monitoring and ensure the safety and well-being of infants.
This project provides a convenient and efficient solution for baby care, utilizing a range of sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules.

🔑 Key Features:

🛏️ Cradle Movement & Cry Detection:

Automatically swings the cradle and alerts caregivers via the Blynk app when the baby cries.

🚨 Urine Detection: 

Rain sensor triggers a 10-second buzzer alarm and notifies caregivers if moisture is detected.


🌡️ Temperature Control:

Automatically controls a fan based on room temperature, turning it on above 25°C and off below 25°C.

📲 Mobile App Integration:

Displays temperature and humidity readings, controls LED lights, and sends notifications for cry and urine detection.

🔧 Components Used:

📡 Sensors: 

Rain Sensor, Temperature & Humidity Sensors (DHT-11, LM-35), Mic Sensor (LM-393)

🖥️ Microcontroller:

Arduino UNO R3

📦 Others: 

Buzzer, Mini Fan, Servo Motor, ESP8266/USB Serial Module, Breadboard, Jumper Wires, LED Light, Baby Cradle

📌 Conclusion:

The Smart Baby Cradle and Monitoring System enhances infant care by providing timely responses and continuous monitoring.
With its reliable sensor network and user-friendly mobile interface, this system offers peace of mind to caregivers and ensures the well-being of the baby.
