The Smart Baby Cradle is a baby care system based on the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed to monitor several vital factors automatically, including cradle movement, buzzer alerts, automatic control of DC fan, and room temperature and humidity levels.
The "Smart Baby Cradle and Monitoring System" is a project aimed at providing a convenient and efficient solution for monitoring and taking care of infants. The system incorporates various sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules to ensure the safety and well-being of the baby. The key components used in the project include a rain sensor, buzzer alarm, Arduino UNO R3, mic sensor (LM-393), mini fan, mini servo motor, breadboard, jumper wires, baby cradle, temperature and humidity sensors (DHT-11 and LM-35), LED light, and an ESP8266/USB serial module.
The primary features of the system include detecting the baby's cry and initiating the swinging motion of the cradle while simultaneously sending a notification to the caregiver through the Blynk app. The system also incorporates a rain sensor to detect urine, triggering an alarm buzzer for 10 seconds and sending a notification to the caregiver via the Blynk app. Additionally, the fan automatically turns off when the room temperature falls below 25 degrees Celsius and turns on when it exceeds 25 degrees Celsius. The temperature readings are displayed on the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE.
The accompanying mobile application offers several features, including displaying the humidity and temperature readings, controlling the LED light with an on/off switch, and sending two types of notifications: one for the baby's cry detection and the other for the detection of urine.
The successful implementation of the "Smart Baby Cradle and Monitoring System" demonstrates its potential to enhance the safety and convenience of caring for infants. By utilizing various sensors and microcontrollers, the system ensures timely response and continuous monitoring, giving caregivers peace of mind and improving the overall well-being of the baby.
